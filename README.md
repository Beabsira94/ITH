## Stages of the Quest

### **Stage 1: The Data Wrangling Initiation â€“ Mastering the Basics**

#### Objective

Master the fundamentals of data cleaning and visualization.

#### Completed Tasks:

1. **Data Cleaning** :

* Addressed missing values using appropriate strategies like mean imputation and forward fill.
* Removed duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.
* Managed outliers by visualizing with box plots and deciding on their relevance.
* Ensured correct data type conversions for all columns.

    **Deliverable** : Cleaned dataset saved as `cleaned_data.csv`.

1. **Basic Visualization** :

* Created bar charts and histograms to highlight trends in the data.
* Added clear labels, titles, and captions for easy interpretation.

### **Stage 2: The Insight Seeker â€“ Mastering Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

#### Objective

Uncover hidden stories and generate actionable insights from data.

#### Completed Tasks:

1. **Summary Statistics** :

* Computed key metrics like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range for numerical columns.
* Presented findings in a tabular format.

1. **Correlation Analysis** :

* Calculated correlation coefficients between numerical variables.
* Created a heatmap to visualize relationships, highlighting strong correlations.

1. **Variable Relationships** :

* Visualized relationships using scatter plots and box plots.
* Provided concise captions explaining each plot's insights.

1. **Insights Summary** :

* Discovered trends such as factors influencing employee attrition and provided a 200â€“300 word summary.

### **Stage 3: The Predictorâ€™s Forge â€“ Building Predictive Models**

#### Objective

Build predictive models to anticipate trends and outcomes.

#### Completed Tasks:

1. **Data Preprocessing** :

* Encoded categorical data using one-hot encoding.
* Scaled numerical features with MinMaxScaler for model consistency.

    **Deliverable** : Preprocessed dataset saved as `preprocessed_data.csv`.

1. **Model Building** :

* Developed a predictive model using **Random Forest** to classify employee attrition.
* Split the data into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets for evaluation.

1. **Performance Evaluation** :

* Assessed the modelâ€™s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
* Visualized results with a confusion matrix.

1. **Model Optimization (Bonus)** :

* Conducted hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to enhance model performance.

1. **Insights Summary** :

* Documented a comprehensive 1000â€“1200 word report detailing:
  * Data preparation techniques.
  * Model selection rationale.
  * Insights from evaluation metrics and areas for future improvement.
